# Bird-Species-Classification-with-MobilenetV2-for-Mobile-Vision-Application

Ornithologists and bird watchers are enthused to find the various colours of beautiful birds and their characteristics of birds. However, people rarely have the knowledge about the birds and have difficulty identifying the types of birds and their characteristics. Even the ornithologists have the identification problem because they need to know all the details of the birds such as biology, distribution, and others. Bird classification can be done with picture, video, and audio.

### Objectives

The main objective is to develop a modified light-weight model with smaller size which is MobilenetV2 that could be implemented in IDE such as android studio to develop a mobile vision application that classify the bird species to classes with good accuracy.

### System Design

### Dataset Description

A dataset was created by selecting 19 categories of birds out of 200 categories of birds from Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 ( http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html).1118 images in total and around 60 images for each category. 19 categories of birds selected from folder which are Crested, Auklet Bobolink, Northern Flicker, American Goldfinch, Evening, Grosbeak California Gull, Anna Hummingbird, Green Jay, Belted Kingfisher, Red breasted Merganser, Mockingbird, Baltimore Oriole, American Pipit, White necked Raven, American Redstart, Cape May Warbler, Golden winged Warbler, Red headed Woodpecker and Cactus Wren.
Dataset can be obtain from this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gk7nrNwBUp3hOGcTjc18T5REtuH0W_4u?usp=sharing ) , by downloading folder named “ CUB_19_2011”
